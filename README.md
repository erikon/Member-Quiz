# Member-Quiz
MDB Mini-Project 1

The Member Quiz app is an introductory game application. It is simply a guessing game including all members of the MDB organization. A single member’s picture is displayed and four options (Buttons) are shown. One has the correct name of the member in the picture and the other three buttons have random member’s names on them. Additionally, users only have 5 seconds to answer and once the timer runs down, a new member’s image is shown and you cannot receive points for that round. The game ends once the user hits the ‘End Game’ Button

The core concepts used included the following:
- Intents
- Timers
- Alert Dialogs
- Toasts
- onClickListeners
